abstract = "Pins are commonly used to join members of mechanical mechanisms. In order to maintain the integrity of the joint and prevent failure, there must be sufficient material of adequate strength around the pin hole to sustain the bearing and tear out loads from the pin connection. In this work, a multi-scale materials simulation model based on finite elements (FE) is developed for design and evaluation of materials for such applications. We specifically examine several constitutive models for simulating the elasto-plastic behavior of the plate material while maintaining computational efficiency. Here, models are developed for two plate materials: copper (Cu) and α-uranium (α-U), with vastly different plastic behaviors owing to their crystal structures and crystallographic textures. For Cu, digital image correlation (DIC) tests are carried out during loading of the plate/pin assembly to characterize the strain distributions in the critical hole/pin area. The corresponding FE simulations are carried out using a combination of constitutive laws involving a fine-scale polycrystal plasticity calculation, a J2 flow theory, or a combination of both. We show that the FE model using the fine-scale polycrystal plasticity constitutive law successfully captures the DIC strain fields in the hole region at different plate displacements. Surprisingly, use of the more computationally efficient J2 plasticity model also produces reasonable results in comparison with the measurements and the fine-scale constitutive law. An interesting finding is that combining fine-scale constitutive laws in the region surrounding the hole and continuum J2 theory elsewhere gives the worst agreement. It also precariously produces non-conservative estimates for the hole opening with applied displacement. These results on Cu helped subsequent simulations on α-U, where use of the fine-scale polycrystal simulation is fundamental considering the highly plastic anisotropic response of this complicated material. We demonstrate that in the α-U plates, the localized deformation in the hole region is highly dependent on the direction of displacement."

abstract = "To better predict material response associated with plastic deformations, plasticity models for behaviors over an extensive range of length scales are being combined to give a more comprehensive representation of the material. The breadth of the length scales naturally enters a more complete material description through the influences that features of the structure of many sizes have on the mechanical responses. The effective inclusion of material structure in simulations is pushing applied plasticity toward more highly quantitative implementations. Computed costs are greater in many respects, but the potential rewards are simulations with much greater relevance to current engineering applications. The focus of this paper is on a number of trends and issues related to these implementations and their use. In particular, we examine the methodologies for describing material structure at multiple scales within the context of simulation and discuss techniques used to compute properties and to evolve the state based on features of the structure."

This EVP extension of the model originally proposed by Moulinec and Suquet to compute the local and effective mechanical behavior of a heterogeneous material directly from an image of its microstructure is based on an implicit time discretization and an augmented Lagrangian iterative procedure. The proposed model is first benchmarked, assessing the corresponding elastic and viscoplastic limits, the correct treatment of hardening, rate-sensitivity and boundary conditions, and the rate of convergence of the numerical method. In terms of applications, the EVP–FFT model is next used to examine how single crystal elastic and plastic directional properties determine the distribution of local fields at different stages of deformation."

Different combinations of final textures and strain distributions are obtained with the CPFFT and CPFEM models for this 1024-grain polycrystal. To further understand these different predictions, the correlation between grain rotations and strain gradients is investigated through the simulation of plane-strain compression of bicrystals. Finally, a study of the influence of the initial crystal orientation and the crystallographic neighborhood on grain rotations and grain subdivisions is carried out by means of plane-strain compression simulations of a 64-grain cluster.}

Synthetic 3D microstructures are created representing single phase equiaxed microstructures for generic copper alloys. Uniaxial tensile deformation is simulated using a 3-D full-field, image-based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) technique with rate-sensitive crystal plasticity, to get local micro-mechanical fields (stress and strain rates). Stress hotspots are defined as the grains having stress values above the 90th percentile of the stress distribution. Hotspot neighborhoods are then characterized using metrics that reflect local crystallography, geometry, and connectivity. This data is used to create input feature vectors to train a random forest learning algorithm, which predicts the grains that will become stress hotspots. We are able to achieve an area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.74 for face centered cubic materials modeled on generic copper alloys. The results show the power and the limitations of the machine learning approach applied to the polycrystalline grain networks."

The steel, fabricated via the laser engineering net shaping technique, has a microstructure comprising primarily of the austenite phase, with ∼ 2.5\% ferrite phase by volume fraction. The post-build material was heated to greater than 1300 K and neutron diffraction data was recorded during heating and cooling. Specifically, the evolution of lattice strains in the individual phases were measured with temperature and the corresponding coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) calculated. The dislocation densities, phase fractions and textures, before and after heat treatment, were also measured. CPFE simulations were performed to study the interplay of the stress-free thermal strains and the mechanical strains in inducing inter-granular residual stresses in individual phases. The simulations confirmed the presence of process induced inter-granular residual stress primarily in the ferrite phase of the as-built AM material. Comparison of the relevant simulation data with experiments indicate that model predictions of the lattice strains and CTEs in both phases, as well as the inter-granular residual phase stress and pressure in the ferrite phase are in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements and calculations."

A combination of experiments (electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), micro-Laue diffraction) and modeling (crystal plasticity finite element (CPFE)) are used. Data from two sets of grain orientations are analyzed and modeled: orientations within 5° of the exact (0002) basal pole (‘near basal’) and those within 5° of the exact (101‾0) prism pole (‘near prism’). In order to maintain similitude with experiments, the actual experimental microstructures (along with their crystallographic orientations) are used as an input for the CPFE simulations. Minor differences are observed for different measures of local misorientation developments. However, the ‘near basal’ grains show higher spread of grain reference orientation deviation, both in experiments and in CPFE simulations, and correlate with the intergranular strain heterogeneity predicted from CPFE simulations. Simulated trends of residual strains also compare favorably with the micro-Laue measurements. The ‘near basal’ grains have higher residual strains as compared to the ‘near prism’ grains. This observed behavior appears to originate from the elastic anisotropy of the hcp crystals and not from differences in the plastic deformation on the different family of slip systems."

	abstract = {The deformation of a single crystal of aluminium in the Goss orientation {011}⟨100⟩ containing a coarse particle of silicon was modelled by using a finite-element (FE) code based on the crystal plasticity approach. The simulations clearly captured the heterogeneous deformation of the aluminium matrix, resulting in a region of high deformation in the vicinity of the hard particle, surrounded by a region where the amount of deformation was significantly lower. The evolution of the corresponding deformation substructure during annealing was simulated using a Monte Carlo technique. The simulations clearly demonstrated the discontinuous evolution of the subgrains in the deformation zone to form recrystallization nuclei around the hard particle, and the subsequent growth of these nuclei to consume the matrix region around the particle. For plane strain compression up to εzz = -0.4 that was used in this study, the deformation texture components near the particle consisted of rotations up to 20° from the initial Goss orientation about the transverse direction. Recrystallization simulations captured the formation and growth of nuclei from the deformation heterogeneities existing near the hard particle and predicted a significant strengthening of the orientations present in the particle deformation zone. The simulation results are shown to capture many of the experimentally observed features of deformation and recrystallization textures in aluminium single crystals containing coarse particles of silicon.}
